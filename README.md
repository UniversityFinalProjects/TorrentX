# torrentx 

TorrentX is a client side software for downloading and uploading torrents through the internet.
There is support for downloading and uploading the same torrent through a cluster which is located in your private network.
This architecture lets  us discover and use more seeders by examining more of them on different virtual/physical machines on a cluster.
