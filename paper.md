TorrentX is a client side software for downloading and uploading torrents through the internet.
There is a support for downloading and uploading the same torrent through a cluster which located in your private network. This architecture let us discover and use more seeders by examining more of them on different virtual/physical machines on a cluster.

TorrentX core algorithms will be developed by us from scratch.
